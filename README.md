# Expense Tracker App

As part of the Python Bootcamp, I created a Python application to record, track, and manage personal expenses.

This simple app allows users to input, update, and view their spending across various categories, helping them stay within budget. More importantly, it serves as a way for me to improve my Python coding skills.
